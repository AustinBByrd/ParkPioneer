# ParkPioneer

## Description:
This all started as an issue I experienced with my current friend group. Every week we have what is called "Park Tuesday," where we select a park to go to and have dinner with all the families and kids. The main issue is the logic of how they pick the parks. They say it's based on location, but they do a terrible job at it. I want to resolve this issue.
